## Plot
![Scatter plot of WO vs Beer](plot.png)

## Interpretation

The scatter plot does show that as the number of WO gradutes increases over the years, the amount of beer consumption does also tend to increase. However this relationship is not strictly linear which does suggest that there are other factors outside of number of WO graduates that affect beer consumption levels
